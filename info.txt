git stuff
1. git status (check git working)
2. git add . (or file name eg git add index.html index.js index.css, '.' adds all)
3. git commit -m "[message]" (documentation of update)
4. git push (sends update)


How to align recipes:

OPTION 1:
Fundamental origin
    - Each recipe is attributed to its national origin
    - How do I handle fusion cuisines? Most have original roots.
    - Is garlic bread fundamentally American or Italian? I don't know.
    - From a user perspective, I think you expect to see "Sweet and Sour chicken" in Chinese, but garlic bread in American.
    - It seems reductive to say "Here's my italian food:" then show Americanised versions.
    - Also, I'm not saying "ITALIAN CUISINE", I'm saying "Here are dishes from italy on a map"

OPTION 2:
Creator origin
    - Each recipe is attributed to the country of the person who last altered it.
    - Many recipes which I have fundamentally altered will be NZ/USA (Depending when I came up with it). 
    - O.G. alfredo: italian. american alfredo: american



FORMATTING NOTES:
DO: || DONT:
 || anything else
tablespoon || Tablespoon
"12 tablespoons", "butter" || "12 tablespoons ", " butter" (I WILL ADD SPACES AT IMPLEMENTATION)
imperial, metric, description || any other layout
100g || 100 g 
1/2 || 0.5
"baking soda" || "baking soda." (Stylically I prefer w/o periods in ingredients)
["blah blah blah", "blah blah blah"] || ["1. blah blah blah", "2. blah blah blah"] (NO numbers)

TO IMPLEMENT LATER:
per-step ingredients
