                    My name is Zachary Glen Irain. I have many unproductive hobbies, but my two productive ones are cooking and coding.
                    <br><br> 
                    Growing up, I was privileged to have a dad who loved cooking, and had mastered dishes from many different cultures. Frankly, it was a privilege I didn't appreciate, and so I declined my dads many invitations to learn to cook from him. I came to regret that decision when I moved to the United States to be with my amazing wife Abby. It meant saying goodbye to the fast food I grew up on, yes, but more importantly my dads cooking and my mums baking. I might have just accepted this but for the fact that I moved into a household that tended not to home cook meals. So if I wanted something fresh and cheap, I had to make it myself (Darryl sweetened the pot by paying for some of the cost of our groceries in exchange for food). Thanks to all of this, I became a prolific cook (But not necessarily a good one - despite what many polite people insist!)
                    <br><br>
                    As an aside, I also care quite a bit about preservation. I would love to use this website to allow my relatives to contribute their favourite recipes for other people, maybe even future generations, to enjoy. That's why I built in the author pages - to recognise the wonderful people who have made me just as wonderful food over the years (And even people who haven't - I would love to preserve Abby's family recipes as well!).
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a very simple cook. I try to make food that's as simple, tasty, and cheap as possible. I don't really have the money for very fancy ingredients, and if I did I think I'd most likely to squirrel it away in savings. I also believe that the more dishes I create, the less I'll enjoy cooking - so I'd much rather a 7/10 meal that takes 30 minutes than a 9/10 that takes an hour. For this reason, you can expect most of my recipes on this site to be pretty utilitarian. 
                    <br><br>
                    A note on those recipes - I want to be very clear that almost every recipe I list is something that I found on the internet or got from a family member, and modified enough that I felt it worth writing down as distinct. I have a huge respect and admiration for people who do create their own unique recipes, but as I said above, I don't have the time or money to spend perfecting new ideas. I mostly tinker around the edges to make recipes that suit my taste.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, thank you for perusing my site! I'm not a musical or creative person, but I do find this to be satisfying in a way I imagine mastering a song on the violin could be.
